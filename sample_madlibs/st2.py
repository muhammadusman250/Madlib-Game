        Once, a boy named **{boy}** lived in a small city. He always complained about **{complaint}**,  
        wishing for a different life.  

        One day, he met a wise man named **{old_man}**, who said,  
        *"Instead of complaining about what you don’t have, be grateful for what you do.  
        Gratitude is the key to true happiness."*  

        **{boy}** realized his mistake and learned to appreciate the present.
